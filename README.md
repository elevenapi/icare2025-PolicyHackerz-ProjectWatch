**PRO-FIL: P**ublic **R**eview and **O**pen-Contracting System for **I**nfrastructures and **L**ocal **P**rocurements

[cite_start]This project, developed by Policy Hackerz [cite: 1, 14, 32][cite_start], proposes a policy solution to address the systemic failures and lack of accountability in public infrastructure procurement[cite: 165]. [cite_start]The core goal is to implement transparency, accountability, and public participation at all stages of public procurement and infrastructures [cite: 196-202]. [cite_start]The need for this is highlighted by events like "Tino's Floods" which exposed a P17.4B infra failure[cite: 7, 10].

## 🛠️ TechStack

The policy solution mandates specific technological components for effective governance:

* [cite_start]**Platform:** A centralized, online, and publicly accessible platform known as the **Open Contracting Portal** [cite: 244-245, 255-256].
* [cite_start]**Data Management:** The portal must provide procurement and contracting data updated in **real time**[cite: 245, 256].
* [cite_start]**Analytics/Algorithm:** Implementation of the **Contractor Risk Index (CRI)**[cite: 247], which calculates risk scores based on four factors:
    * [cite_start]Dominance or exposure [cite: 248]
    * [cite_start]Market concentration [cite: 248]
    * [cite_start]Budget consumption [cite: 248]
    * [cite_start]Delayed projects [cite: 248]
* [cite_start]**Reporting/Engagement:** The portal must allow citizens to report suspected irregularities, corruption, delays, or substandard work[cite: 246, 257].

## 💡 Methodology

[cite_start]The PRO-FIL policy solution is built around a framework of **Prevention** and **Participation** [cite: 193-195]:

* [cite_start]**Policy Goal:** Upholding transparency, accountability, and public participation to prevent corruption and collusion, improve projects, and respond to community needs [cite: 196-208].
* [cite_start]**Intervention: Open Contracting Portal**[cite: 244].
* [cite_start]**Intervention: Contractor Risk Index (CRI)**[cite: 247].
* [cite_start]**Intervention: Pre-Award Engagement** [cite: 249][cite_start]: Mandatory consultation with community leaders, CSOs, or academic institutions [cite: 250][cite_start], including a **Citizen Observer Pool** and **Integrity Screening**[cite: 251].

This methodology is anchored on established governance principles:

* [cite_start]**Open Government Partnership Framework:** Utilizing principles of civic participation, transparency, and the use of technology [cite: 232-234].
* [cite_start]**Community-Based Monitoring Framework:** Integrating citizen monitoring at all stages of the procurement process to lessen oversight and misuse of funds [cite: 236-237].

## 📊 Insights and Analysis

Analysis of contractor and procurement data revealed alarming systemic indicators:

| Metric | Top 8 Contractor | Average Contractor | Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Median Wealth** | [cite_start]6.02 B Php [cite: 52] | [cite_start]68.6 M [cite: 53] | [cite_start]A top contractor takes home **88 times more money** than the average contractor[cite: 34]. |
| **Number of Projects** | [cite_start]73.5 [cite: 55] | [cite_start]2 [cite: 56] | |
| **Average Project Size** | [cite_start]84 M Php [cite: 58] | [cite_start]34 M Php [cite: 59] | |

**Key Behavioral Insights:**

* [cite_start]**Budget Consumption:** A dominant cluster of contractors' budget consumption percentages are tightly concentrated near **90–100%** of the ABC (Approved Budget of Contracts)[cite: 63].
* [cite_start]**Delays and Overspend:** The system often results in project delays and overspending (Overspend % vs Delay days)[cite: 71].
* [cite_start]**Problem Statement:** The failure stems from **Opacity in Procurement**, **Silence from Stakeholders**, and **Over-Delayed Accountability**[cite: 164, 171, 179].

## 💾 Setup and Installation Guide

As this is a policy proposal, there is no software to install. Implementation requires a legislative or executive mandate.

**Policy Solution is Legally Based on:**
* [cite_start]Bill of Rights - Right to Information (Art. III, Sec 7, 1987 Constitution) [cite: 216-219, 264].
* [cite_start]Policy of Public Disclosure (Art. II, Sec 28, 1987 Constitution) [cite: 220-223, 265].
* [cite_start]Accountability of Public Officers (Art. XI, Sec 1, 1987 Constitution) [cite: 224-227, 266].

## 📚 Data Source

The project's insights are derived from analysis of official government data and public records:

* [cite_start]**Contractor Performance Data:** Used to determine market concentration, wealth, project size, and inputs for the CRI [cite: 45-59].
* [cite_start]**National Budget Data:** Used to chart Total Budget per Year and Top Regions by Budget[cite: 104, 120].
* [cite_start]**Procurement Records:** Used for the Histogram of Contractor Budget Consumption[cite: 80].
* [cite_start]**Existing Laws:** Republic Act No. 3019 (Anti-Graft), RA No. 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act), and RA No. 6713 (Code of Conduct) [cite: 157-159].
* [cite_start]**News Reports:** Data on the impact of Typhoon Tino and infrastructure failure [cite: 7-13].
