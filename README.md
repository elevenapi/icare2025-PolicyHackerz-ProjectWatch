**PRO-FIL: P**ublic **R**eview and **O**pen-Contracting System for **I**nfrastructures and **L**ocal **P**rocurements

This project, developed by Policy Hackerz, proposes a policy solution to address the systemic failures and lack of accountability in public infrastructure procurement. The core goal is to implement transparency, accountability, and public participation at all stages of public procurement and infrastructures

## 🛠️ TechStack

The policy solution mandates specific technological components for effective governance:

* **Platform:** A centralized, online, and publicly accessible platform known as the **Open Contracting Portal** .
* **Data Management:** The portal must provide procurement and contracting data updated in **real time**.
* **Analytics/Algorithm:** Implementation of the **Contractor Risk Index (CRI)** which calculates risk scores based on four factors:
    * Dominance or exposure 
    * Market concentration 
    * Budget consumption 
    * Delayed projects 
* **Reporting/Engagement:** The portal must allow citizens to report suspected irregularities, corruption, delays, or substandard work

## 💡 Methodology

[cite_start]The PRO-FIL policy solution is built around a framework of **Prevention** and **Participation*:

* **Policy Goal:** Upholding transparency, accountability, and public participation to prevent corruption and collusion, improve projects, and respond to community needs
* **Intervention: Open Contracting Portal**.
* **Intervention: Contractor Risk Index (CRI)**.
* **Intervention: Pre-Award Engagement**: Mandatory consultation with community leaders, CSOs, or academic institutions, including a **Citizen Observer Pool** and **Integrity Screening**

This methodology is anchored on established governance principles:

* **Open Government Partnership Framework:** Utilizing principles of civic participation, transparency, and the use of technology
* **Community-Based Monitoring Framework:** Integrating citizen monitoring at all stages of the procurement process to lessen oversight and misuse of fund

## 📊 Insights and Analysis

Analysis of contractor and procurement data revealed alarming systemic indicators

**Key Behavioral Insights:**

* [cite_start]**Budget Consumption:** A dominant cluster of contractors' budget consumption percentages are tightly concentrated near **90–100%** of the ABC (Approved Budget of Contracts)[cite: 63].
* [cite_start]**Delays and Overspend:** The system often results in project delays and overspending (Overspend % vs Delay days)[cite: 71].
* [cite_start]**Problem Statement:** The failure stems from **Opacity in Procurement**, **Silence from Stakeholders**, and **Over-Delayed Accountability**[cite: 164, 171, 179].
